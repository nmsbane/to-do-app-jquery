# to-do-app-jquery
A to-do application built using pure css, jquery, font-awesome.

It is a simple application of To-Do list. It is developed using pure css and jquery. 

I built this simple app to reinforce my undertanding of jquery and css.

The various concepts that i learnt in this project are as follows:

In CSS:
  I learnt the importance of these properties: 
    box-sizing, float, outline, transisiton.
  How to include gradients, font-awesome and google fonts.
  
In jQuery:
  I learnt about event propogation, and how to stop propogating it to other elements.
  Difference between, $(<ELEMENT>).click(function() { }); and $(<ELEMENT>).on('click', function() {});
  And how to add new html elements when you  click, '+' icon to add new to-do item.
  
# how to run the app

Just clone it and run index.html file.

Please note that, the to-do items are not preserved. It does not use any database to preserve the to-do items. 

The main purpose of this simple project is to understand DOM Manipulation using jQuery and getting comfortable with pure css.
